## About

In my search for a vscode theme, I kept running into the same issues that drove me away:

- Background color was too blue and/or bright
- Foreground colors were too dark, bright, and/or warm
- Red and/or orange-red appeared too frequently in syntax highlighting
- Color distribution was just not to my taste in general

So, I'm trying to create a theme that fits the following criteria:

- A dark, slightly cold background color that isn't close to black
- Foreground colors with a moderate contrast that use warm colors sparingly
- Red and red-adjacent colors reserved only for rare and/or important syntax

Colors are subject to change, I'm prioritizing distribution of colors over color values for now.

## Installing / Usage

The standalone theme is far from complete, it is recommended to use the custom [settings](./settings/settings.json) with [One Dark Pro](https://github.com/Binaryify/OneDark-Pro) for now.

Simply cope and paste the contents of my [settings.json](./settings/settings.json) into vscode's settings.json file.

Only the editor has custom colors applied, the rest of the window will be re-colored after colors are set in stone.
